    <h3>
      Lesson 6-D
    </h3>
    <p>
      Imagine an amusement park that has a discount for children (6 years and younger) or seniors (65 years and older).<br>
      - Create a variable 'age' and savea person's age inside.
      - Create an if-statement that checks if the person qualifies for a discount. If they do, display 'Discount' in the console. Otherwise, display 'No discount' in the console.
      - Try changing the 'age' variable to display different messages.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Lesson 6-E
    </h3>
    <p>
      Continuing from exericse 6d, let's say the discount is only available if it is not a holiday. Create a variable: const isHoliday = true;<br>
      - Update the code so that in order to get a discount, people must meet the age requirement and it is also not a holiday.<br>
      - Try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages.
    </p>
  </body>
  <script>
    const age = 5; // Change this value to test different messages
    const isHoliday = false; // Change this value to test different messages

    if ((age <=6 || age >= 65) && !isHoliday) {
      console.log('Discount');
    } else {
      console.log('No discount');
    }
  </script>
